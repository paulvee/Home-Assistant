# Home-Assistant
Information and scripts for Home Assistent

This is using the HACS/Pyscript add-in to test things out.
It provides an almost full Python envorinment that can be used together with the Home Assistant environment.

I used the GUI install, first HACS, then Pyscript.
There is nothing added to my configuration.yaml.

I created a folder in config with the name pyscript and put all the related files in there.

Most of what I found and needed to do is listed as comments in the code.
