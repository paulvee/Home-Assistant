# Home-Assistant
Information and scripts for Home Assistent

The two scripts are to be used with the HACS/Pyscript add-in.
It provides an alomst full Python envorinment that can be used together with the Home Assistant environment.

I used the GUI install, first HACS, then Pyscript.
There is nothing added to my configuration.yaml.

Most of what I found and needed to do is listed as comments in the code.
